# Scenario Based Interview Questions on EC2, IAM and VPC

## VPC Architecture Design

**Q:** You have been assigned to design a VPC architecture for a 2-tier application. The application needs to be highly available and scalable. How would you design the VPC architecture?

**A:** In this scenario, I would design a VPC architecture in the following way:
   - I would create 2 subnets: public and private.
   - The public subnet would contain the load balancers and be accessible from the internet.
   - The private subnet would host the application servers.
   - I would distribute the subnets across multiple Availability Zones for high availability.
   - Additionally, I would configure auto scaling groups for the application servers.

## Network Access Control

**Q:** You want to implement strict network access control for your VPC resources. How would you achieve this?

**A:** To implement granular network access control for VPC resources, we can use Network Access Control Lists (NACLs). NACLs are stateless and operate at the subnet level. We can define inbound and outbound rules in the NACLs to allow or deny traffic based on source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols.

## Private Subnet Internet Access

**Q:** You have a VPC with a public subnet and a private subnet. Instances in the private subnet need to access the internet for software updates. How would you allow internet access for instances in the private subnet?

**A:** To allow internet access for instances in the private subnet, we can use a NAT Gateway or a NAT instance. We would place the NAT Gateway/instance in the public subnet and configure the private subnet route table to send outbound traffic to the NAT Gateway/instance. This way, instances in the private subnet can access the internet through the NAT Gateway/instance.

## Secure Access to Private Instances

**Q:** You have a private subnet in your VPC that contains a number of instances that should not have direct internet access. However, you still need to be able to securely access these instances for administrative purposes. How would you set up a bastion host to facilitate this access?

**A:** To securely access the instances in the private subnet, you can set up a bastion host (also known as a jump host or jump box). The bastion host acts as a secure entry point to your private subnet:
   - Create a new EC2 instance in a public subnet, which will serve as the bastion host.
   - Configure the security group for the bastion host to allow inbound SSH (or RDP for Windows) traffic from your IP address or a restricted range of trusted IP addresses.
   - Place the instances in the private subnet and configure their security groups to allow inbound SSH (or RDP) traffic from the bastion host security group.
   - SSH (or RDP) into the bastion host using your private key or password. From the bastion host, you can then SSH (or RDP) into the instances in the private subnet using their private IP addresses.

## IAM, Users, Groups, Roles, and Policies

**Q:** What is the difference between IAM users, groups, roles, and policies?

**A:** IAM components explained:
   - IAM User: Represents an individual or application needing access to AWS resources. Has permanent long-term credentials.
   - IAM Role: Similar to a user but not associated with a specific individual. Assumed by entities to obtain temporary security credentials.
   - IAM Group: A collection of IAM users for easier permission management.
   - IAM Policy: Defines permissions and access controls in AWS, can be attached to users, roles, and groups.

## Isolated Environment in VPC

**Q:** Your organization requires an isolated environment within the VPC for running sensitive workloads. How would you set up this isolated environment?

**A:** To set up an isolated environment within the VPC:
   - Create a subnet with no internet gateway attached (isolated subnet).
   - Place sensitive workloads in this subnet.
   - Ensure they are protected from inbound and outbound internet traffic.
   - If outbound internet access is needed, set up a NAT Gateway/instance in a different subnet and configure the isolated subnet's route table to send outbound traffic through it.

## Secure Access to AWS Services

**Q:** Your application needs to access AWS services, such as S3, securely within your VTC. How would you achieve this?

**A:** To securely access AWS services within the VPC, use VPC endpoints:
   - Create VPC endpoints for specific AWS services (e.g., S3, DynamoDB).
   - Associate them with the VPC.
   - This enables secure and efficient communication between VPC instances and AWS services.

## Restrict Outbound Internet Access

**Q:** Your organization has a VPC with multiple subnets. You want to restrict outbound internet access for resources in one subnet but allow outbound internet access for resources in another subnet. How would you achieve this?

**A:** To restrict outbound internet access for one subnet and allow it for another:
   - Modify the route table associated with the subnet to be restricted.
   - Remove the default route (0.0.0.0/0) pointing to an internet gateway.
   - For the subnet requiring internet access, keep the default route pointing to the internet gateway.
