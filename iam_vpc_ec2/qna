## Scenario Based Interview Questions on EC2, IAM and VPC

### Q: You have been assigned to design a VPC architecture for a 2-tier application. The application needs to be highly available and scalable. How would you design the VPC architecture?

```markdown
A: In this scenario, I would design a VPC architecture in the following way.

   I would create 2 subnets: public and private. The public subnet would contain the load balancers and be accessible from the internet. The private subnet would host the application servers. 

   I would distribute the subnets across multiple Availability Zones for high availability. Additionally, I would configure auto scaling groups for the application servers.
